# Welcome to Synastra 👋  
**Aligned by Vision, Driven by Purpose.**

🌌 **Synastra** is a creative software house founded by two digital dream-builders.
We are committed to turning meaningful ideas into real, impactful digital solutions — with harmony, clarity, and soul.

## ✨ About Us

At Synastra, we believe that every idea has the potential to shine.  
Our name combines two words: **"Synchrony"** (alignment) and **"Astra"** (star) — a reflection of our mission to craft technology that is both purposeful and luminous.

We don't just build software — we co-create visions into reality.
